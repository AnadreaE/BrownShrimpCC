# BrownShrimpCC/Data

Brown shrimp size class model / Data 

## Description 

The data used in this Thesis work is: 
- Landings of Brown Shrimp: 'BLE_Onlandslandungen_SpeiseKrabbe'
Contains the reported landings of brown shrimp in German ports (assumed in the research to be equal to the landings within German waters). The data was downloaded from BLE (Bundesanstalt für Landwirtschaft und Ernährung)  licensed under DL-DE-2.0.  

- Water temperature: 'temperature_10ger'
Is a file edited from the original file of the temperature from www.kuestendaten.de, station bhv_alte_weser_leuchtturm licensed under DL-DE-Zero-2.0.


## Installation

## Usage 

Temperature data are needed to run simulations. 
Landing data were used in the research to estimate the initial conditions and Shrimp abundance, and to validate the results by comparing the fishery catch quantities with the actual Landing data from Germany.
